The following midterm project for Engineering Analysis II (MENG 21200) covered numerical methods and analysis in Python and utilized the NetworkX library to analyze disease propagation through populations. This project simulates the SEIR model on lattice, small-world, and scale-free networks, capturing realistic local interactions in disease transmission. With Python & NetworkX, visualize how infections evolve over time, compare different network topologies, and uncover key insights into epidemiology and complex systems.
