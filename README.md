Explore how diseases spread through populations using network models! This project simulates the SEIR model on lattice, small-world, and scale-free networks, capturing realistic local interactions in disease transmission. With Python & NetworkX, visualize how infections evolve over time, compare different network topologies, and uncover key insights into epidemiology and complex systems
